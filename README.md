LAB 1:

In this lab, we have to write a C program that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to a certain number ("n" in my code) and prints the sum. 
Eventually, we must compare the outputs compiled by the GCC compiler and the RISC-V compiler. 


For this task we are using the Leafpad text editor provided in Linux.

The following is the code to calculate the sum from "1" to "n" in C language.

After the GCC compilation, we get the following output:

The following photo shows both the screens (the code, and the output generated from the GCC compilation):
